## Features
- Computes the circumference of a circle.
- Calculates the area of a circle.
- Determines the volume of a sphere.
- Uses precise floating-point calculations.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/circle-sphere-calculations.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd circle-sphere-calculations
   ```
3. Ensure Python 3.x is installed.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python circle_calculations.py
   ```
2. Enter the radius when prompted.
3. The script outputs the calculated circumference, area, and volume.

## Example
```sh
Please enter the radius of your circle/sphere: 5
The circumference of a circle with a radius of 5.0 is 31.4159
The area of a circle with a radius of 5.0 is 78.5398
The volume of a sphere with a radius of 5.0 is 523.5988
```

## Functions
- **`get_radius()`**: Prompts user for radius input.
- **`circumference_of_circle(r)`**: Calculates circumference.
- **`area_of_circle(r)`**: Computes the area of a circle.
- **`volume_of_sphere(r)`**: Determines the volume of a sphere.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
